# PWC Power BI Job Simulation on Forage
Recently, I finished the job simulation offered by PwC Switzerland on Forage, during which I contributed to several significant projects that enhanced my data analysis skills and knowledge. These projects covered areas such as call center trends, customer retention, and diversity & inclusion analysis. Each project provided valuable insights and practical experience, deepening my understanding of these important topics. Iâ€™d like to highlight the three projects I worked on and the key takeaways from each.
## Task 1: Call Center Trend
I received a request from Claire, the Call Centre Manager at PhoneNow, to design a Power BI dashboard that would creatively present the key metrics and KPIs in their dataset. Claire emphasized the need for creativity.The task was to develop a dashboard that would clearly display essential KPIs, such as customer satisfaction, call response and abandonment rates, time-based call breakdowns, average answer speed, and a performance quadrant comparing average handle time against the number of calls answered. The Dataset was provided by PWC company.

### Tools Used:
Excel : To check data accuracy, missing value and outliers 2 Power BI : For data profiling, cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, transform and standardizing data formats to ensure uniformity.

#### Data Analysis:
The dataset was examined using DAX formulas to generate measures that effectively represent the key performance indicators (KPIs).

#### Key Insights:
Call Volume: The total number of calls received was 5,000. Abandoned Calls: 946 calls were abandoned, pointing to potential improvements needed in customer wait times and service efficiency. Answered Calls: 4,054 calls were answered, demonstrating the call center's ability to handle a high volume of incoming calls. Resolved Calls: 3,646 of the answered calls were successfully resolved, highlighting strong problem-solving capabilities within the team. Unresolved Calls: 1,354 calls were left unresolved, suggesting a need for deeper analysis to understand underlying issues and develop strategies for improving resolution rates. Average Pickup Speed: The average pickup time was 67.52 seconds, showing that while the response time is reasonable, there is potential for optimization to further enhance the customer experience. Average Call Duration: Call durations notably increased during peak hours (11 AM to 1 PM), likely due to higher call volumes and more complex issues. The majority of calls were related to streaming, followed by technical support and other issues, contributing to longer handling times.

#### Agent Performance:
Staffing: The call center was staffed with 8 agents. Calls per Agent: With 5,000 calls in total, each agent handled approximately 625 calls. This suggests a heavy workload for each agent, highlighting the need to monitor fatigue and performance to ensure consistent service quality.

#### Customer Satisfaction:
Average Satisfaction Rating: The average customer satisfaction score was 3.40 out of 5, indicating general satisfaction but also room for improvement in delivering exceptional service.

#### Recommendations:
1. Reduce Abandoned Calls: Implement strategies to minimize call abandonment, such as optimizing call routing, increasing staff during peak periods, or providing
customers with estimated wait times.
2. Improve Call Resolution: Focus on training and providing agents with the necessary resources to resolve more issues during the first contact, reducing the
number of unresolved calls.
3. Enhance Agent Support: Monitor agent workload and provide additional support or breaks to prevent burnout, ensuring sustained high service quality.
4. Increase Customer Satisfaction: Collect and analyze customer feedback to identify specific areas for improvement and implement targeted initiatives
to raise satisfaction ratings.

Conclusion: The call center is effectively managing a large volume of calls with a high resolution rate. However, the number of abandoned and unresolved calls, combined with a moderate customer satisfaction rating, highlights areas for improvement. Although the average pickup speed is reasonable, further optimization could enhance the overall customer experience.
