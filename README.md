# PWC Power BI Job Simulation on Forage
Recently, I finished the job simulation offered by PwC Switzerland on Forage, during which I contributed to several significant projects that enhanced my data analysis skills and knowledge. These projects covered areas such as call center trends, customer retention, and diversity & inclusion analysis. Each project provided valuable insights and practical experience, deepening my understanding of these important topics. I’d like to highlight the three projects I worked on and the key takeaways from each.

## Task 1: Call Center Trend
I received a request from Claire, the Call Centre Manager at PhoneNow, to design a Power BI dashboard that would creatively present the key metrics and KPIs in their dataset. Claire emphasized the need for creativity.The task was to develop a dashboard that would clearly display essential KPIs, such as customer satisfaction, call response and abandonment rates, time-based call breakdowns, average answer speed, and a performance quadrant comparing average handle time against the number of calls answered. The Dataset was provided by PWC company.

### Tools Used:
1. **Excel:** To check data accuracy, missing value and outliers
2. **Power BI:** For data profiling, cleaned by handling missing values, removing duplicates, transform and standardizing data formats to ensure uniformity.

#### Data Analysis:
The dataset was examined using DAX formulas to generate measures that effectively represent the key performance indicators(KPIs).

#### Key Insights:
1. **Call Volume:** The total number of calls received was 5,000.
2. **Abandoned Calls:** 946 calls were abandoned, pointing to potential improvements needed in customer wait times and service efficiency.
3. **Answered Calls:** 4,054 calls were answered, demonstrating the call center's ability to handle a high volume of incoming calls.
4. **Resolved Calls:** 3,646 of the answered calls were successfully resolved, highlighting strong problem-solving capabilities within the team.
5. **Unresolved Calls:** 1,354 calls were left unresolved, suggesting a need for deeper analysis to understand underlying issues and develop strategies for improving resolution rates.
6. **Average Pickup Speed:** The average pickup time was 67.52 seconds, showing that while the response time is reasonable, there is potential for optimization to further enhance the customer experience.
7. **Average Call Duration:** Call durations notably increased during peak hours (11 AM to 1 PM), likely due to higher call volumes and more complex issues. The majority of calls were related to streaming, followed by technical support and other issues, contributing to longer handling times.

#### Agent Performance:
1. **Staffing:** The call center was staffed with 8 agents.
2. **Calls per Agent:** With 5,000 calls in total, each agent handled approximately 625 calls. This suggests a heavy workload for each agent, highlighting the need to monitor fatigue and performance to ensure consistent service quality.

#### Customer Satisfaction:
**Average Satisfaction Rating:** The average customer satisfaction score was 3.40 out of 5, indicating general satisfaction but also room for improvement in delivering exceptional service.

#### Recommendations:
1. **Reduce Abandoned Calls:** Implement strategies to minimize call abandonment, such as optimizing call routing, increasing staff during peak periods, or providing customers with estimated wait times.
2. **Improve Call Resolution:** Focus on training and providing agents with the necessary resources to resolve more issues during the first contact, reducing the number of unresolved calls.
3. **Enhance Agent Support:** Monitor agent workload and provide additional support or breaks to prevent burnout, ensuring sustained high service quality.
4. **Increase Customer Satisfaction:** Collect and analyze customer feedback to identify specific areas for improvement and implement targeted initiatives to raise satisfaction ratings.

**Conclusion:** The call center is effectively managing a large volume of calls with a high resolution rate. However, the number of abandoned and unresolved calls, combined with a moderate customer satisfaction rating, highlights areas for improvement. Although the average pickup speed is reasonable, further optimization could enhance the overall customer experience.

## Task 2: Customer Retention

### Objectives
1. What is the total number of customers?
2. What is the churn rate?
3. What is the retention rate?
4. What are the average monthly charges?
5. Are there any significant trends in customer demographics?
6. The Dataset was provided by PWC company.

### Tool - Power BI
For data profiling, check outliers, handling missing values, removing duplicates, transform and standardizing data formats to ensure uniformity.

#### Key Findings:
1. **Customer Demographics:** The dataset includes 7,043 customers, with males making up 50.5% (3,556) and females 49.5% (3,487).
2. **Retention and Churn:** The retention rate is 73.46%, while the churn rate is 26.54%.
3. **Revenue Insights:** The total charges across all customers amount to $16.06 million, with an average monthly charge per customer of $64.76.

#### Key Insights:
1. **Gender Distribution:** The near-equal male-to-female customer split indicates a balanced customer base. Further analysis could reveal any gender-specific preferences or challenges affecting retention rates differently.
2. **Retention vs. Churn:** A retention rate of 73.46% is positive, but the 26.54% churn rate signifies a substantial portion of customers leaving. Investigating the reasons behind this churn should be a priority.
3. **Revenue Insights:** The total and average monthly charges suggest moderate customer spending. It's important to assess whether customers view these charges as fair and identify opportunities to increase value without causing dissatisfaction.

#### Recommendations:
1. **Create Customer Engagement Strategies:** Develop personalized offers, loyalty programs, or promotions to engage all customers, irrespective of gender and enhance customer retention.
2. **Gather and Act on Customer Feedback:** Regularly collect feedback from customers through surveys or other methods and act on it to improve services and resolve issues that may contribute to dissatisfaction.

## Task 3: Diversity and Inclusion Analysis

### Objectives
1. Total number of current employees?
2. How many employees left the organization in the past year?
3. Demographics of new hires, particularly by gender and age?
4. Employees promoted and what is the gender breakdown of those promotions?
5. How do performance ratings differ by gender?
6. Distribution of employees by job type (full-time vs. contract)?
7. The overall turnover rate and what does it indicate about the organization’s retention strategies?

### Tool : Power BI
For data profiling, check outliers, handling missing values, removing duplicates, transform and standardizing data formats to ensure uniformity.

#### Key Insights:
1. **Total Employees:** The organization has a total workforce of 500 employees, with 295 men and 205 women. Over the past year, 47 employees have left the company.
2. **New Hires:** Women made up 51.5% of new hires, while men represented 48.5%. Notably, younger women were hired in the 20–29 and 40–49 age ranges, whereas men were predominantly hired in the 30–39 and 50–69 age brackets.
3. **Promotions:** 10.2% of employees were promoted, with men comprising 6.6% and women 3.6%. This suggests a potential gender disparity in promotion opportunities.
4. **Performance Ratings:** Men consistently received higher performance ratings than women, indicating possible biases in the evaluation process.
5. **Job Type:** Among full-time staff, 293 were men and 172 were women, while contract staff included 2 men and 33 women, highlighting a gender imbalance in job security and type.
6. **Turnover Rate:** The turnover rate is 86.8%, raising concerns about employee retention and indicating a need for stronger retention strategies.

#### Recommendations:
1. **Promotion Equity:** Establish clear and transparent criteria for promotions to ensure equal opportunities for advancement for all employees, regardless of gender.
2. **Performance Evaluation:** Review and revise the performance evaluation process to identify and eliminate any biases that may unfairly disadvantage certain groups.
3. **Job Security:** Address the gender disparity in job types by creating more opportunities for women to transition from contract to full-time positions.
4. **Retention Strategies:** Develop retention strategies, especially for groups with higher turnover rates, such as healthcare benefit, retirement plans and conducting regular exit interviews to understand the reasons behind departures.

#### Conclusion:
The analysis highlights several diversity and inclusion concerns within the organization. While gender distribution among new hires is relatively balanced, disparities in promotions, performance ratings, and job types suggest challenges in achieving true equity. The high turnover rate further underscores the need for the organization to evaluate and adjust its policies and practices to support long-term employee retention and satisfaction.
